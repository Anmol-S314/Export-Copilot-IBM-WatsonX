The Problem
Exporting is a high-stakes, manual process filled with risks:

Complex Paperwork: A single error in documentation can trap shipments in customs for weeks.

Confusing Regulations: Navigating customs codes (HS Codes) and international compliance is a specialized skill.

Market Uncertainty: Businesses often enter new markets with incomplete data, leading to costly guesswork.

Constant Change: Trade policies and regulations are constantly shifting, making it nearly impossible for SMEs to stay compliant.

The Solution: An Agentic AI Framework
Export Co-Pilot solves this by deploying a team of specialized AI agents that work together to manage the export process. Instead of one AI, we have a team of experts, each powered by IBM watsonx.

Our Team of AI Agents:
Document Validator Agent: The meticulous compliance officer. It validates documents for consistency and completeness.

Company Profile Agent: The business analyst. It synthesizes documents into a profile to provide context for other agents.

Trade Classification Agent: The customs expert. It instantly determines the correct HS code, customs duty, and required documentation.

Freight Rate Analyzer Agent: The logistics specialist. It analyzes live market data to find the most efficient and cost-effective shipping options.

Market Intelligence Agent: The market entry strategist. It generates a full report on competitors, consumer trends, and entry strategies for a target country.

Compliance Risk Monitor Agent: The proactive risk manager. It constantly scans for global regulatory changes and provides actionable alerts to ensure compliance.
